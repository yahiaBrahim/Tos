-----------------
Quick Hints:
------------
0- A complete documentation is in the "Documentation" folder;
1- To try TestOS, you need a virtual machine, you can use qemu,bochs or vmware ...
2- To compile and try TestOS :
	* go to the directory of testOS
	* sudo make install	
	* sudo make ct
3-To compile TestOS without trying it with qemu, use :
	make c	

4- if you get an error, make sure you are root, and that you are in the directory
   of TestOS, to solve the problem you can go to the Makefile, look at the section "ct" 
   which has links to different other sections, modify all those sections as you need.
